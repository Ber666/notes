This post records how to build this blog.
1. fork a template (like [this](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio))
2. rename a project name (`notes` for this blog)
3. make a new commit and push
4. in the repo setting `Pages`, choose `gh-pages` branch and `/root` folder

Following this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6AJ9qPPoyc), I also tried to deploy the page locally but fails due to some environment issues...
