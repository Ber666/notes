## What is reinforcement learning?
- Mathematical formalism for **learning-based decision making**
- Approach for learning decision making and control **from experience**
> mark: OK now I know the connection between RL and decision making, but what's the difference between decision making and control?

##  How is this different from supervised learning?
- Non-i.i.d: previous outputs influence future inputs
- No ground truth answer is provided

## Beyond learning from reward
- Basic reinforcement learning maximizes reward
- More advanced topics
  - Learning reward functions from examples (inverse RL)
  - Transferring knowledge between domains (transfer learning, meta learning)
  - Learning to predict and using the prediction to act
> mark: is transfer learning/meta learning directed related to RL? Is the third point model-based RL/world model?
